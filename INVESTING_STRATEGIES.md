## Low Risk Strategy: Passive, Wide Range, Blue-Chip Pools

- **Description:**
  - Provide liquidity across a wide price range (or full range) for stable or blue-chip pairs (e.g., USDC/DAI, ETH/USDC).
  - "Deposit and Forget" approach: minimal active management, low chance of going out of range.
  - Lower capital efficiency, but minimizes risk of impermanent loss and out-of-range status.
  - Best for users who want steady fee income and minimal maintenance.
- **Key Risks:**
  - Lower APR compared to concentrated or volatile pools.
  - Opportunity cost vs. staking or HODLing.
- **Example Pools:**
  - USDC/DAI, USDC/ETH (large cap, high TVL, low volatility)

## Medium Risk Strategy: Managed Range, Selective Rebalancing

- **Description:**
  - Provide liquidity in a moderately narrow range around the current price for major pairs (e.g., ETH/USDC, WBTC/ETH).
  - Monitor price and rebalance (move range) if price moves outside the set band.
  - Balances higher fee income with moderate risk of impermanent loss and going out of range.
  - Some active management required (e.g., weekly or after large price moves).
- **Key Risks:**
  - Impermanent loss if price moves sharply and you don't rebalance.
  - Out-of-range risk if not monitored.
- **Example Pools:**
  - ETH/USDC (medium range), WBTC/ETH, or blue-chip pairs with moderate volatility

## High Risk Strategy: Tight Range, Volatile or Exotic Pairs, Active Management

- **Description:**
  - Provide liquidity in a very tight range around the current price, or for volatile/exotic pairs (e.g., new tokens, low TVL pools).
  - Requires frequent monitoring and rebalancing—sometimes daily or even hourly.
  - Highest capital efficiency and fee potential, but also highest risk of impermanent loss and going out of range.
  - Suitable for advanced users who can actively manage positions and tolerate losses.
- **Key Risks:**
  - Large impermanent loss if price moves outside range and is not rebalanced.
  - Out-of-range = no fee income.
  - Volatility and low liquidity can amplify losses.
- **Example Pools:**
  - New or trending tokens, high volatility pairs, or very tight range on ETH/USDC

## Additional Notes

- **Impermanent Loss:** All LPs are exposed to impermanent loss, especially in volatile markets or with concentrated (tight) ranges.
- **Fee APR vs. Risk:** Higher fee APR usually means higher risk. Always compare to HODL or staking benchmarks.
- **Active vs. Passive:** Passive strategies are safer but less profitable. Active strategies can outperform but require time, tools, and risk management.
- **Tools:** Use analytics dashboards and simulators to backtest and monitor your LP positions (e.g., DefiLlama, Uniswap Analytics, yewbow.org).
